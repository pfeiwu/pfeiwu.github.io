    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have been learning German. I have learned some of the basic words and sentences.I hope to continue learning it.</p><p>As a native Chinese speaker, itâ€™s not easy for me to get used to a completely different language like German.There are hardly any similarities between these two languages. Luckily, I am capable of speaking essential English thanks to compulsory education in China, so I can manage to learn German through English.</p><p>I have found Duolingo to be an easy way to start. However, if I want to delve deeper into it, I will need to find another method. I have heard that DW is an app to learn German more seriously and systematically. I will give that a shot.</p>]]></content>
