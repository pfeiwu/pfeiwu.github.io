    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I’m obsessed with a game called PalWorld. It’s a game that is similar to Pokémon, but with guns and more<br>realistic graphics.<br>It has a big open world, you can build your own base and craft items, fight pals(PalWorld’s version of Pokémon), or you<br>can catch pals and let them fight for you or do some work for you.<br>Like other crafting games, it’s always more fun to play with friends, to do so, you can start a multiplayer game and<br>then invite your friends to join, which can take up to 4 players.<br>If you want more people to join, you need to start a dedicated server. Firstly I deploy a Linux version, however, I<br>found it was buggy, so I switched to Windows version. My server is on the cloud, with 4 cores and 8GB RAM. It’s not a<br>powerful server, but it’s enough for a small group of people to play together.<br>It seems like the server program has an issue that it will crash after running for a while because of memory leak. So I<br>wrote a script to monitor the server and restart it when it crashes, and I open-sourced it on GitHub. </p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my MacBook crashed. I had no choice but to restart it by pressing and holding the power button. When it was ready, I found that I couldn’t access the Internet anymore despite being connected to the Wi-Fi. I tried the self-diagnosis but to no avail. After some troubleshooting, I found a way to refresh the Wi-Fi setting by simply deleting and recreating it. To do so, open the network tab and right-click the Wi-Fi in the System Settings, then choose to delete the Wi-Fi service. Then click the button at the bottom (with three dots on it) to create a new Wi-Fi service. That’s it. Hopefully, your network will be restored.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have been learning German. I have learned some of the basic words and sentences.I hope to continue learning it.</p><p>As a native Chinese speaker, it’s not easy for me to get used to a completely different language like German.There are hardly any similarities between these two languages. Luckily, I am capable of speaking essential English thanks to compulsory education in China, so I can manage to learn German through English.</p><p>I have found Duolingo to be an easy way to start. However, if I want to delve deeper into it, I will need to find another method. I have heard that DW is an app to learn German more seriously and systematically. I will give that a shot.</p>]]></content>
