Today my MacBook crashed. I had no choice but to restart it by pressing and holding the power button. When it was ready, I found that I couldn't access the Internet anymore despite being connected to the Wi-Fi. I tried the self-diagnosis but to no avail. After some troubleshooting, I found a way to refresh the Wi-Fi setting by simply deleting and recreating it. To do so, open the network tab and right-click the Wi-Fi in the System Settings, then choose to delete the Wi-Fi service. Then click the button at the bottom (with three dots on it) to create a new Wi-Fi service. That's it. Hopefully, your network will be restored.
